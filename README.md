* Cats vs Dogs Classifier

This project is an image classification model that distinguishes between images of cats and dogs. Using a pre-trained convolutional base (VGG16) trained on ImageNet, the project demonstrates two approaches to building a classifier for the Cats and Dogs Dataset from Kaggle.

** Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Cats and Dogs Dataset from Kaggle. It contains:

25,000 images (12,500 images of cats and 12,500 images of dogs).
The total dataset size is 543 MB (compressed).
For this project, the dataset was split into three subsets:

Training set: 1,000 samples per class (2,000 total images).
Validation set: 500 samples per class (1,000 total images).
Test set: 1,000 samples per class (2,000 total images).

**Approach
This project leverages transfer learning with the VGG16 convolutional base to extract rich, high-level features from the images. Two approaches were explored:

1. Feature Extraction with a Standalone Classifier
The pre-trained VGG16 convolutional base was used to extract features from the dataset.
These features were saved as NumPy arrays to disk.
A standalone, densely connected classifier was trained on these precomputed features.
Advantages:
Fast and computationally inexpensive, as the convolutional base processes each image only once.
Limitation:
Does not support data augmentation, which could improve the model's robustness.

2. End-to-End Fine-Tuning
The convolutional base was extended by adding Dense layers on top, and the entire model was trained end-to-end.
This approach allowed for data augmentation, where input images were dynamically transformed during training to improve generalization.
Advantages:
Fully utilizes the power of data augmentation.
Limitation:
Computationally expensive, as the convolutional base processes every image during every epoch.

**Model Architecture
Pre-trained Convolutional Base (VGG16)
Trained on ImageNet.
Extracts meaningful features from input images.
Standalone Classifier
Fully connected dense layers for classification.
End-to-End Model
Input Layer: Accepts resized images of shape (150, 150, 3).
Convolutional Base: VGG16 (frozen or partially fine-tuned).
Dense Layers: Added on top for classification.
Output Layer: A dense layer with a softmax activation for binary classification (Cat or Dog).

**Key Libraries
TensorFlow/Keras: For implementing and training the model.
NumPy: For numerical operations and saving feature arrays.
Matplotlib: For visualizing training progress and results.

**Project Workflow

***Data Preprocessing:
Resized images to (150, 150).
Applied data augmentation (for end-to-end training).

***Feature Extraction:
Ran the dataset through the VGG16 convolutional base.
Saved the output features as NumPy arrays.

***Training:
Trained a standalone classifier using the extracted features.
Fine-tuned the extended model end-to-end with data augmentation.

***Evaluation:
Evaluated both approaches on the test set.
Results
Standalone Classifier:
Achieved high accuracy with minimal computational resources.
Faster training and inference times.
End-to-End Model:
Achieved slightly higher accuracy due to data augmentation.
Computationally more expensive, but more robust.
